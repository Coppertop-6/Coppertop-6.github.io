# My BlackHat and Decfon 2022 experience.

In 2022 I once again got the opportunity to attend BlackHat and Defcon. I managed to also attend a two day Applied Web Application Hacking training course presented by Sensepost / Orange Cyberdefense.

Being the first real trip post covid there was a sense of nervousness when arriving at the airport... This quickly disappeared once we entered the lounge before our long-haul flights to have a couple of beers... 20+ hours of travel to get to the US.

Registration unfortunately only opened on the morning that training started. So this ended up causing a massive line-con and delayed the start of training by an hour or two.

*The Training:*

I chose to attend the two-day Applied Web Application Hacking that would include the following:

**Practical training:**

1. Essential theory
2. Mostly hands-on practical web application hacking
3. 25 practical’s, various levels of difficulty
4. Fine line between challenge and not learning
5. 2 days, 10+ practical’s a day
6. Most of them will take between 15 and 30 minutes

Overall I found the course material to be informative and to the point. It gives you a broad understating of basic pentest techniques that will give you a good base understanding of the OWASP testing process. 

*Briefings and Business hall:*

Day one of briefings always seems jam-packed with excellent talks that always run at the same time... Two of my favourite briefings that I manged to attend were: 

Day one of briefings always seems jam-packed with excellent talks that always run at the same time... Two of my favourite briefings that I managed to attend were: 

Industroyer2: Sandworm's Cyberwarfare Targets Ukraine's Power Grid Again. Speakers: Robert Lipovsky, Anton Cherepanov

“Industroyer2 – a new version of the only malware to ever trigger electricity blackouts – was deployed in Ukraine amidst the ongoing Russian invasion. Like in 2016 with the original Industroyer, the aim of this recent cyberattack was to cause a major blackout – this time against two million+ people and with components amplifying the impact, making recovery harder.”

Backdooring and Hijacking Azure AD Accounts by Abusing External Identities
Speaker: Dirk-jan Mollema

“External identities are a concept in Azure Active Directory which makes it possible to collaborate with users outside of an organization. These external users, often called guest users, can be granted permissions to certain resources and work together with users within the organization. The identities of these users are managed in a different Azure AD tenant, or are unmanaged accounts outside of Azure AD.

This talk explained how these external identities work in Azure AD and how concepts such as B2B collaboration are facilitated. During the research for this talk, several flaws in the implementation were identified, which create novel ways to backdoor and hijack Azure AD accounts from a regular user. There were also ways identified to exploit these external identity links to elevate privileges, bypass Multi Factor Authentication and Conditional Access policies. All these attacks were possible in the default configuration of Azure AD.”

The business hall was quite underwhelming this year. There were still loads of looting to be done but the gatekeepers of the swag made you work for it. Sitting down to listen to product demos, speaking to a rep for 20 minutes for a t-shirt etc. 

Trend Micro presented an Arsenal talk around red teaming with the option of some hands-on keyboard action. This was definitely one of my highlights of the few days of BH. We managed to crack more than half of the challenges and were second on the leaderboard. A well-deserved t-shirt and coin :-)
 
### <ins>Defcon 30</ins>

With jetlag starting to hit quite hard the weird and wonderful Defcon 30 was upon us. After more time than I am willing to admit we finally found the Ceasars Forum… The l33t hackers turned out in their thousands with hardly any space to move. This made navigating the halls a massive chore.

Myself and Synthet1c proceeded to roam through all the villages with the end goal being to enter a CTF. $10 beers were bought and an empty table was found where we could setup and start hacking.

After what seemed like hours of setup we finally started getting points on the board and managed to walk away at the end of day one in the top 5. We walked back to our hotel leaving the still crowded halls to buy food and beers to keep us fuelled for the evenings hacking. This was probably one of the highlights of the trip. Sitting in a Vegas hotel room, music going, “oh I managed to crack this one… Come see how I did it” and a few drinks. 

The next day was more of the same at Defcon. Busy busy busy. We managed to buy some swag on day two and mission around to all the villages again. We built paper planes, a tinfoil hat and watched some of the smartest hacking teams in the world compete in the main Defcon CTF. 

On the last day needless to say we took things easy and met up with a few guys from SA. We discussed Security things and just caught up on the craziness that was BH and Defcon. We did one last pass of the main CTF and found a random mini plastic mushroom that we still don’t know what or why it was where it was ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
