## Pentesting JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are a popular method for implementing authentication and authorization in modern web applications. JWTs are compact and self-contained, making them easy to use and transmit as a URL parameter, cookie value, or in the HTTP Authorization header. However, like any other security mechanism, JWTs can be vulnerable to attacks if not implemented correctly. 

### What are JWT Tokens?

Before we begin, let's quickly review what a JWT token is. A JWT token is made up of three parts: the header, the payload, and the signature. The header contains information about the token's type and algorithm, the payload contains the user's claims, such as their ID and role, and the signature is a hash of the header, payload, and a secret key. The header and payload are base64 encoded JSON strings, and the signature is a hash of the header, payload, and a secret key.

In this blog post, we will focus on how to pentest JWT tokens, with a particular focus on their expiry, editing Roles within payloads, and refresh tokens.

### Testing Expiry

One of the essential features of JWT tokens is their expiry. Expiry ensures that the token is valid only for a limited time, and after that, the user has to log in again. If the expiry time is not set correctly, it may lead to unauthorized access or session hijacking.

To test the expiry of JWT tokens, we can use Burp Suite's Intruder feature. We can send multiple requests to the server with different JWT tokens and observe the server's response. If the server accepts an expired token, it means that the expiry is not implemented correctly. We can also use the JWT.io website to decode the token and check the expiry claim.

### Editing Roles within the Payload

One of the common vulnerabilities in JWT tokens is the ability to edit the user's role within the payload. If a user can edit their role, they may gain unauthorized access to restricted areas or perform actions they should not be able to perform.

To test the ability to edit roles within the payload, we can use Burp Suite's Repeater feature. First, we need to obtain a valid JWT token and copy it to the clipboard. Next, we create a new request in Burp Suite's Repeater and paste the token into the appropriate field. Then, we use the Decoder feature to decode the payload and identify the user's role. We can then modify the role's value to a higher privileged role, such as an admin, and encode the payload back to base64. Finally, we send the modified request and observe the server's response. If the server accepts the modified token, it means that the ability to edit roles within the payload is not implemented correctly.


### Testing Refresh Tokens

Refresh tokens are long-lived tokens used to obtain new access tokens after the expiry of the previous one. Refresh tokens are used to provide a seamless user experience and avoid frequent logins. However, if refresh tokens are not implemented correctly, they may lead to session fixation attacks.

To test refresh tokens, we can use Burp Suite's Repeater feature. First, we obtain a valid refresh token and copy it to the clipboard. Next, we create a new request in Burp Suite's Repeater and paste the refresh token into the appropriate field. Finally, we modify the token's expiry time and send the request. If the server accepts the modified token, it means that the refresh token is not implemented correctly. 

### Conclusion

JWTs can be vulnerable to attacks if not implemented correctly.
